Good to know you find here.

This is the Plama dev team, actually it's just me, Juntong Liu, current year 3 student at University of Liverpool. Plama is my final year project. Generally speaking, it is used to render and analyze the data generated by md2d model. It should provide multimedia rendering functionalities when finished.

Maybe you want to know more about the name. The name comes by merging the word "plasma" and "lama". So why "lama"? Honestly speaking, no reason, just because they are kind of funny animals and I don't want to be too serious on the name.

The project is work in progress, and it is planed to be finished before I graduate.
