So this is the first article I write about the project. I'm writing this because the programming work is finally starting. So at the time I set up the main repository, there is no reason for me not to setup a website for it.  Previous weeks I was just learning to use the simulating program, Plasimo. Of course I'm not a good user at this stage, and I'm just like a kindergarten child by the understanding of plasma. There is a lot to learn, but it's quite enough for me to get started.

As you can see, the repository has been set up today and there is just a very simple demo program. It is simply a calculator for elementary arithmetics. I spent some days learning Qt. Even though the demo program is very poor in functionalities, it can validate many of my understanding, including the project structure, the Qt designer, the signal system and many things about Qt development.

It might not be a bad idea to give some basic information about this project at this stage. Generally speaking, this is a program that help the user read plasma simulation data. It is planned to provide functionalities in data analyze, data visualization and multimedia output. Currently it focuses on md2d model output, but I will not focus too much on data format since you know, I'm not a specialist in plasma research. Otherwise I might provide more format support as plugins. I have written tons of codes, if you have checked my github homepage, while I'm not familiar with desktop development, especially in C++. So it will take me some time to get familiar with it.

I might provide some ideas to get started in Qt development later in another article. See you later.
